Inserted fixture part number "44200L" into the fixture object file.
   The fixture part number was selected based on the fixture parameters
   specified.  If you wish to use an alternative fixture part number, please
   list the fixture object and replace the fixture part number in the fixture
   file with one of the other recognized part numbers described in the manual.

 
Trying to find a placement for the board that is compatible
   with the board handler.

Board "Pinedrops_M_73-19246-05" has potential locations that are outside the probable area
   of the fixture.   Subsequent fixture software may have no alternative
   but to use some of these locations for probing to insure access to
   all nodes.  Selecting a new board placement could eliminate this
   problem. (WARNING BPL85)

The board "Pinedrops_M_73-19246-05" was placed at X =  30198, Y = -77677
  with a rotation of  0.000 degrees.

     Module Pin Assignment was run at the standard experience level.
 
Remote sense measurement for Node 10GBE_FLSHP_MISO_CP on Board Pinedrops_M_73-19246-05 
would be improved with a second probe.  Only one probe for this 
node was found in the fixture. Two probes are required to separate 
signal from sense. (WARNING MPA425)

     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 4.313.
            The standard deviation is 2.246.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 2076 interface pins for 1713 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.825.
 
            The wirelist references 2062 interface pins on pin cards.

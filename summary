  An analog powered test or analog part of a mixed test contained pins
  or nodes that were not accessible or not connected or defined in the board
  file. Consult the ipg/summary file to identify the problem device(s). IPG
  will mark the tests 'nulltest' in the testorder file if any pins or nodes
  in the test are unconnected or undefined in the board file. (WARNING IPG2800)



  Nodes on this board are not accessible.  Check the ipg/summary file 
  to identify the nodes, and verify that they should be inaccessible.



  A capacitor discharge test was generated, and is in the analog 
  directory.  Deletions of IPG-generated discharge statements in 
  the discharge file may result in damage to the scanner relays.



  Tests were generated for diodes and/or zeners that contain large-value
  parallel capacitors. To work correctly, including failing when the
  component is reversed, these tests may require a wait statement (wa) to
  be added manually.

     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 4.272.
            The standard deviation is 2.188.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 2045 interface pins for 1685 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.824.

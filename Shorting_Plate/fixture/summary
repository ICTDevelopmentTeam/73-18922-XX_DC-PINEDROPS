Inserted fixture part number "44200L" into the fixture object file.
   The fixture part number was selected based on the fixture parameters
   specified.  If you wish to use an alternative fixture part number, please
   list the fixture object and replace the fixture part number in the fixture
   file with one of the other recognized part numbers described in the manual.

Trying to find a placement for the board that is compatible
   with the board handler.

Board "Pinedrops_M_73-19246-05" has potential locations that are outside the probable area
   of the fixture.   Subsequent fixture software may have no alternative
   but to use some of these locations for probing to insure access to
   all nodes.  Selecting a new board placement could eliminate this
   problem. (WARNING BPL85)

The board "Pinedrops_M_73-19246-05" was placed at X =  30198, Y = -77677
  with a rotation of  0.000 degrees.

     Module Pin Assignment was run at the standard experience level.
 
     The assignment was restricted to drilled personality pin locations.
 
                      ASSIGNMENT REPORT FOR ALL BOARDS
 
     SUMMARY STATISTICS
 
        For precision nodes:
 
            The average BRC to probe distance is 4.272.
            The standard deviation is 2.188.
 
            * precision nodes include critical nodes, digital 
              nodes, and analog nodes using external 
              instrumentation or the time interval counter
 
        For all nodes:
 
            The assignment used 2070 interface pins for 1710 nodes.
            The efficiency is 0.826.

The node U10_CP_PRESENCE_SWITCH_PIN_2 appears in the wirelist but not in the fixture description.
If fixture tooling is run in expert mode the node will be added to the
fixture.o file with the resource pins but will not have an assigned probe.
 (WARNING FXT13)
The node U10_CP_PRESENCE_SWITCH_PIN_2 was added to the fixture description file.
 (WARNING FXT14)
The node 'VDD_SW_91' is being removed from the fixture 
 since it is inaccessible, has no test resources assigned to it or both.
